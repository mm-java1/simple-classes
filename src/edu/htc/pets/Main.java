         Answer the following questions using comments in your code.
         Write code to show that you tried to do these things (comment it out if it doesn’t compile).
         Use comments to explain what you found.

         --------- Question 1
         Can you create a Cat without a name?
         --------- Answer 1 -- yes
         cat[0] = new Cat();
         ---------------------------------------------------------

         --------- Question 2
         Can you create a Dog without giving it a name?
         --------- Answer 2 -- no, the program will not compile
         dog[0] = new Dog();
         Error:(62, 18) java: constructor Dog in class edu.htc.pets.Dog cannot be applied to given types;
         required: double,java.lang.String
         found: no arguments
         reason: actual and formal argument lists differ in length
         ---------------------------------------------------------

         --------- Question 3
         What happens if you try to put a dog in the cat array? Does it compile? Does the code run?
         --------- Answer 3 -- Program will not compile.
         cat[0] = new Dog();
         Error:(25, 18) java: incompatible types: edu.htc.pets.Dog cannot be converted to edu.htc.pets.Cat
         ---------------------------------------------------------

         ---------- Question 4
         What does a Cat or Dog object look like if you print it?
         ---------- Answer 4 -- This the output is a weird string
