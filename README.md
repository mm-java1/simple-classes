    # simple-classes

    ## Homework 3

    We're going to write a two classes to bundle our work from last week into a Java classes for Cats and Dogs.

    Java Classes are a foundational part of the language and thinking in terms of classes and packaging functionality into classes is an integral part of Java development.


    ## GitHub Info
    Repository:  https://github.com/htc-ccis2595/simple-classes

    You need to fork this repository and submit a pull request to turn in the assignment.  Please post a screenshot of the pull request to the D2L dropbox.  The dropbox is mainly used to communicate due dates, not for storing the completed work.  You do not need to upload the project to D2L, only to GitHub.

    ## Assignment
    Use InteliJ to create a new project called simple-classes in the spot where you clone the GitHub Repository.  You may be prompted to create a project from existing sources.  If so, answer Yes.

    Take a look at the code that you are provided.  There are three classes inside the edu.htc.pets package folder inside of src.  You will update these java files as indicated below.

    ### Cat Class
    Update the Cat class to have the following private *instance variables*:

     - name
     - age

    Add get and set functions for both the name and age.  (i.e. getName/setName and getAge/setAge)

    Add a getHumanAge function, that uses the calculation you worked out last week. Unlike your function from last week, this *method* should __NOT__ require any input, as the Cat object is already aware of its own age.  Use the age instance variable in the calculation, and return the equivalent human age.

    ### Dog Class
    Update the Dog class to have the following private *instance variables*:

     - name
     - age

    Add a constructor that requires a name.

    Add get and set functions for both the name and age.  (i.e. getName/setName and getAge/setAge)

    Add a getHumanAge function, that uses the calculation you worked out last week. Like the method for the Cat class above, this *method* should __NOT__ require any input, as the Dog object is already aware of its own age.  Use the age instance variable in the calculation, and return the equivalent human age.

    ### Main Program
    In your Main class's main method, you will create 3 cats and 3 dogs, put them into an array and use a loop to display information about each animal.  Note that I want you to use a different loop for the cats and the dogs

    #### Cat code
    Let's start with the cats.

    1. Create an empty array to hold the Cat objects you will create.
    2. Create a cat, setting it's name and age, then add it to the array.
    3. Create two more cats, also setting their names and ages, then add each of them to the array.
    4. Print a message to say you are displaying the cat information.
    5. Set up a regular __for__ loop with a counter to go through the cat array and print the cat's name, age, and then human age. Use nice messages so we can tell what you are printing.

    #### Dog code
    Now it's time for the dogs.

    1. Create an empty array to hold the Dog objects you will create.
    2. Create a dog, setting it's name and age, then add it to the array.
    3. Create two more dogs, also setting their names and ages, then add each of them to the array.
    4. Print a message to say you are displaying the dog information.
    5. Set up a __for-each__ or an enhanced for loop to go through the dog array and print the dog's name, age, and then human age. Use nice messages so we can tell what you are printing.

    ### Code Questions
    Answer the following questions using comments in your code.  Write code to show that you tried to do these things (comment it out if it doesn't compile). Use comments to explain what you found.

    1. Can you create a Cat without a name?
    2. Can you create a Dog without giving it a name?
    3. What happens if you try to put a dog in the cat array?  Does it compile?  Does the code run?
    4. What does a Cat or Dog object look like if you print it?  (Extra: Can you figure out how to make it print pretty?)


    ## Test and Submit your work
    Make sure to look at your program output and check that you are calculating the correct human ages, and while it sounds silly, look that you are in fact seeing the names and ages that you expect based on the values that you set.

    When complete, push your changes to GitHub and create a pull request for your work.  Place a screen-shot of that pull request in the dropbox.
